### 1.1 Prerequisites

Install nodejs in version 18.12.1

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

I recommend using vscode as a code editor for this project

### 1.2 Launching the project

- Fork the repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `npm install` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `npm start` command will allow you to run the micro API.
